          <h2>About Me</h2>
          <p>
            I'm Nicole Green and I'm a grad student at Syracuse University. I'm majoring in
            Journalism Innovation and looking forward to graduating this December.
            Currently, I live in Thousand Oaks, California with my 15 year old son, Nicolas.
            You can find us hiking, playing basketball and enjoying the sunshine.
